### Challenge Synopsis

You are tasked with security management of a high level conference between foreign delegates held at
“Crown Renaissance Resort”. 

You have received reports that a terrorist organisation is planning to kidnap Mr.
Dastan, the President of United AI, who chairs the conference. 

The intelligence team has also managed to
retrieve pictures of the kidnapper, also known as “White Stinger”.

Your task is to prepare for a search-and-rescue mission in the event that Mr. Dastan is kidnapped. To
achieve this, two models are needed:

● Computer vision models that are able to detect and identify (1) Mr. Dastan, and (2) White Stinger.

● Automatic speech recognition model to interpret your intelligence team’s communications about the
whereabouts of Mr. Dastan
